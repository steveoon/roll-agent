# @roll-agent/reply-authority-client

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#112](https://github.com/steveoon/roll-agent/pull/112) [`1fe17c6`](https://github.com/steveoon/roll-agent/commit/1fe17c6f0fb342c5487d4e1e797e0e37c9392530) Thanks [@steveoon](https://github.com/steveoon)! - 新增候选人地点信号（`locationSignals`）管道，供 Reply Authority 生成更贴近门店/区域的回复（Issue [#111](https://github.com/steveoon/roll-agent/issues/111)）。
  - `@roll-agent/reply-authority-client`：新增 `CandidateLocationSignalSchema`，`GenerateReplyToolInput` 支持可选 `locationSignals`。
  - `@roll-agent/browser-use-agent`：`job-signals` 通过 LLM 明确区分地点咨询与非地点咨询，地点咨询时抽取原文地点证据，非地点咨询时返回空信号；LLM 失败时仅返回资料城市/区域弱信号；`zhipin_get_candidate_info` 与 `zhipin_generate_reply_preview` 透传 `locationSignals`，并在浏览器内展示地点分析/生成进度。
  - `@roll-agent/smart-reply-agent`：re-export 地点信号 schema，保持与 Reply Authority 契约一致。

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [#91](https://github.com/steveoon/roll-agent/pull/91) [`7ba7324`](https://github.com/steveoon/roll-agent/commit/7ba73245068d1340424ff5e27438201c560c4a2b) Thanks [@steveoon](https://github.com/steveoon)! - Add Reply Authority shared client, browser-use streaming reply preview, and prepared reply sending.

  Browser-use now streams Reply Authority progress into an in-page preview panel, stores signed replies
  behind opaque `preparedReplyId` values, and sends via `zhipin_send_prepared_reply` without exposing
  signed envelopes to callers. Sending reuses the currently selected chat when it already matches the
  prepared reply target, while still reopening and validating stale targets as a fallback. The preview
  panel also shows a lightweight loading spinner during generation.

  Smart-reply now reuses the shared Reply Authority client for the existing non-streaming
  `generate_reply` flow. The shared Reply Authority schema now accepts `modelConfig.reasoning`, so
  orchestrators can explicitly request reasoning/thinking mode for smart replies. Browser-use exposes
  the same choice as a narrow `reasoning` option on `zhipin_generate_reply_preview`, while preserving
  opaque prepared reply artifacts instead of passing signed envelopes through orchestrators.
